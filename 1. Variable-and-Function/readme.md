Understanding Variables

- What is a variable?
A container for storing data values.
Values can change during program execution.

- Declaring variables:
Use let, const, or var keywords.
1. let and const are preferred in modern JavaScript.
2. let for variables that can be reassigned.
3. const for variables that cannot be reassigned (constants).

- Data types:
1. Numbers (integers, floating-point numbers)
2. Strings (textual data)
3. Booleans (true or false)
4. Null (empty value)
5. Undefined (value not assigned yet)
6. Objects (complex data structures)
7. Arrays (collections of values)

- Variable naming:
Use descriptive names.
Start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
! Case-sensitive.
