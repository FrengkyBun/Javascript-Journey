Let's Dive into JavaScript!

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used to create interactive web pages. It's the backbone of dynamic web content, from simple animations to complex web applications.

Great news! You don't need much to start learning JavaScript. Here's the simplest setup:

1. Simple text editor: Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), or a free code editor like Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code.
2. Web browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. These browsers have built-in developer tools that are essential for testing JavaScript code.
